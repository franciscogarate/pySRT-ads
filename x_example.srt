1
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:46,498
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen,

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,572
but I found the best thing to do
with the new employee

3
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:51,693
is to size them up
with a long hard stare.

4
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,764
- So!
- So.

5
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,088
- First day!
- Yes!

6
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:13,543
- Scary...?
- Yes...

7
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:15,851
- Don't be scared!
- Oh I'm not really scared.

8
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:16,442
You should be!

9
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:18,561
- Well I'm a little bit scared.
- What? Don't be!

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,654
Make up your mind!

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,605
So here you are!

12
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:23,073
Yes.

13
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm... really looking forward to...

14
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,561
- getting to grips with the...
- I'm gonna put you in I.T.

15
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,933
Because you said on your CV you had
a lot of experience with computers.

16
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,290
I did say that on my CV yes.

17
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:38,415
I have lots of experience
with the whole...

18
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:42,126
computer... thing you know, e-mails...

19
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:47,138
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails,
deleting e-mails...

20
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,577
- ... I could go on.
- Do!

21
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:55,870
The Web... Using mouse...
mices... using mice.

22
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,551
Clicking... double clicking...

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,939
the computer screen of course,
the keyboard...

24
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,259
the...bit that goes on the floor
down there...

25
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,780
- The hard drive?
- Correct.

26
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,487
Well, you certainly seem
to know your stuff.

27
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:12,332
That settles.
Got a good feeling about you Jen!

28
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,049
And they need a new manager.

29
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,074
Oh fantastic!

30
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,365
So... the people I'll be working with,
what're they like?

31
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,974
Standard nerds!

32
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,257
Hello I.T.?

33
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:10,867
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

34
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:16,860
OK, well, the button on the side,
is it glowing?

35
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,513
Yeah, you need to turn it on!

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,674
The button, turns it on?!

37
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:29,934
Yeah... You... Yeah...

38
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,045
You do know how a button works,
don't you?

39
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,742
No, not on clothes!

40
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:35,896
Hello, I.T.?

41
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:37,914
Yeah?

42
00:03:39,324 --> 00:03:42,251
Have you tried forcing
an unexpected reboot?

43
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,896
No, no! There you go! No there you go,
I just heard it come on.

44
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,820
No no, that's the music you hear
when it comes on.

45
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,498
No, that's the music you hear when...

46
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:51,922
I'm sorry, are you from the past?!

47
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:56,158
See the driver hooks a function
by patching the system call table.

48
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,500
So it's not safe to unload it,

49
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,146
unless another thread's about
to jump in there and do its stuff.

50
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:03,301
... and you don't want to end up
in middle of invalid memory.

51
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:06,575
Hello?

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,184
Oh really? Really, why don't you come
down here and make me then?

53
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:14,101
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!

54
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,756
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for ya!

55
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,321
That told her!

56
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,517
Oh God, it's about time you got back,
it's been all go.

57
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,421
You had a job?

58
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:27,180
Girl on fifth...

59
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:29,233
Did you and her... hit it off?

60
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,868
Define "hit it off"?

61
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:35,879
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

62
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,088
No...

63
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:42,724
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

64
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,487
- No?!
- Yep!

65
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:46,825
Unbelievable!

66
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,859
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us
up there, no respect whatsoever!

67
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,638
We're all just drudgens to them.

68
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:52,422
Yes!

69
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,449
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

70
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:55,988
that is what we'd be to them.

71
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,123
It's like they're pally-wally

72
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:58,765
when there's a problem
with their printer

73
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,062
but once it's fixed...

74
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,764
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

75
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:03,174
Yes!

76
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:07,080
Yesterday's jam!
That is what we are to them!

77
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,814
Actually you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing...

78
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,213
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

79
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,740
Hello, I.T. ?

80
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,867
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

81
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:26,308
Unisex toilets? You have unisex toilets,
like Ally McBeal?

82
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,259
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

83
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,618
A lot of sexy people not doing
much work... and having affairs.

84
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:43,260
Oh my God! Look at that view!

85
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,492
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

86
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,270
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.

87
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:52,849
<i>Floor 34.</i>

88
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:57,013
Great sir, thank you.
OK. Where am I going?

89
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,866
All... the way down to the basement.

90
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:01,681
Good luck!

91
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,441
<i>Get out of the lift...</i>

92
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,244
- Oh. Won't be a tick!
- Oh my God!

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,907
Oh  my God! Oh God! OK.

94
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,547
Hello?

95
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,012
Hello?

96
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:45,410
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,977
I'm sorry, myself and Morris
were just engaged

98
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:51,560
in quite a serious discussion
about books and such.

99
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,440
We didn't hear you come in.

100
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,602
Wait a second, you said it was
Tolstoy, he said what?

101
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,461
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

102
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:00,242
When have you read Tolstoy?

103
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,703
Shut up, Morris!

104
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,433
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

105
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:07,207
When did... I don't remember
this conversation at all!

106
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,442
Don't... don't let me disturb you,
I just wanted to come down....

107
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:14,027
Don't be silly you never dist...

108
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,852
Many people come down here to visit!

109
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,746
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

110
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:32,456
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?!

111
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:37,972
So... What can we do you for?

112
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:42,124
I'm the new head of this department.

113
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,901
Is this my office?

114
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,047
Why? What did she... Did she just say...

115
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:52,255
-  I am the head of this department!
- I thought I was.

116
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:56,280
It's one of us! Certainly not her!
I'm gonna sort this out...

117
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,833
Roy! You've got a head wound there...
Head wound!

118
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:01,432
Hi!

119
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,445
I don't wanna be rude or anything

120
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,875
but I wasn't informed of any changes
to this department.

121
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,016
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

122
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:09,649
No!

123
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,207
And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much,

124
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,629
we're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

125
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:16,657
Sure... sure...

126
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,266
You know you're covered in blood?

127
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,747
Moss!

128
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,814
Amazon thingy.

129
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:24,276
Ah! Wicked!

130
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,909
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

131
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,875
I got the child edition
and the adult edition

132
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,000
just to check that there are
no differences in the text.

133
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,194
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able
to deal with that woman!

134
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,306
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!

135
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,035
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.

136
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,392
Come in!

137
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:55,136
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

138
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,954
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

139
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,911
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

140
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:03,821
Yeah, I know.

141
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,958
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

142
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:09,465
Ok!

143
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,781
Ok, take care, take care!

144
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:13,452
Ok bye! Bye!

145
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,511
Oh, so, hello!

146
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,976
What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

147
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,698
Hello. I was just wondering...

148
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:25,468
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

149
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:36,018
No no no... No.

150
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,917
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.

151
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,379
But how?!

152
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:45,588
Oh do you mind... Do you mind
closing the door for me?

153
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,942
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Yeah, Ok.

154
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:50,821
Yeah. From the other side...

155
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:53,673
Of course.

156
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,907
- Like this?
- That's it!

157
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,678
- With me on the...
- Thanks!

158
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,352
Are you all right?

159
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:16,801
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

160
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:19,628
The nurse said I didn't do myself
any serious damage.

161
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:20,867
I'm standing over here!

162
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,405
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

163
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,632
What we gonna do about her?

164
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:28,521
Well, I just went in, and she was having
a pretend conversation.

165
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,077
- Really?
- Yes.

166
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:33,655
She's a little bit weird...
to say the least.

167
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:35,835
What's that?

168
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,214
Oh just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

169
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,683
and this helps cool it down.

170
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,798
She is quite the oddbod...

171
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,712
Did you notice how
she didn't even get excited

172
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,566
when  she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

173
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,515
Yeah, that was weird.

174
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,919
It's almost as if she doesn't know
anything about computers.

175
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:52,764
What?!

176
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,363
Look what you did!

177
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,886
Oh don't worry that's why
I always make 2 cups of tea.

178
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,569
Anyway, what were we talking about?

179
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:02,540
Oh, her not knowing anything
about computers.

180
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,283
What?!

181
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,909
<i>The IT Crowd continues next!</i>

182
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,852
<i>O.K., so we definitely want to get rid of her.</i>

183
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,284
I agree yeah.

184
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:15,498
Ok, so, here's the plan:

185
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,717
A plan? Let me put on
my slightly larger glasses.

186
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,161
Ok, hit me!

187
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,515
- Ok. We go in...
- When?

188
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,339
You know, like in a minute.

189
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,665
Will that be enough time for me
to get to know the plan?

190
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,300
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!

191
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:39,485
I... I've clearly gotten you
over-excited!

192
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,393
Would "steamed" be a better word?

193
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:44,453
Although that's just as exciting,
I might even use these.

194
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:51,440
All I was gonna say was...

195
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,963
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks
about computers

196
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,449
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

197
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,313
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

198
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:04,636
Let me do the talk.

199
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:05,309
All right.

200
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,269
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

201
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,006
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

202
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,260
We... we need to stay calm.

203
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:15,804
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

204
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,431
Hang on, guys.

205
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,295
How can I help?

206
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,139
Well, we were just wondering
now that you're "The Boss",

207
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,422
would you like us to access
the data supplier

208
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,814
and connect you up to the matrix?

209
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,345
You just made all that up?

210
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,865
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

211
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,927
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there,

212
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,741
and do some work, to do with computers!

213
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,908
I'll be in there in a minute
and check up on you!

214
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,230
Ok, lady!

215
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:03,631
You've won this round, but we can wait!

216
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:05,878
You will slip up one day,

217
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,402
and believe you me,
we will be there when you do!

218
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,442
There will be some piece of evidence
that will prove

219
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,592
without  any shadow of a doubt

220
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,442
that you don't know
anything about computers.

221
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,617
What are you doing?

222
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,505
Plugging in your computer.

223
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,965
It might be something you say...

224
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,583
or something you do!

225
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:26,596
But when we notice this,
and believe me we will notice this,

226
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,197
there's gonna be a long way down
for you, sweet chicks!

227
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,102
He'll  realise in a second...

228
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:48,387
I cannot believe you're going
to tell on me.

229
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,011
You're like a pair of horrible
old women.

230
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,517
What did she say?

231
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,137
She said we're like horrible old women.

232
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:57,421
She didn't!

233
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,301
Hey guys!

234
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:00,779
Ok, got something to tell me?

235
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,476
Yes, well, it's like this:

236
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:04,942
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

237
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:07,324
- Yeah.
- Team players each and every one of you.

238
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,332
Yeah, what she...

239
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,865
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team!

240
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,409
Excuse me.

241
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:13,762
Hello?

242
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,067
What?!

243
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,815
Well if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired!

244
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:20,580
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!

245
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,311
Hello, Security?

246
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,424
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

247
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,172
Escort them from the premises.

248
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,297
And do it as a team!

249
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,313
Remember you're a team, and if you can't
act as a team, you're fired too!

250
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:33,475
Dawn!

251
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,304
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team

252
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,285
that can work as team.

253
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,172
They may have to escort our
security team from the building,

254
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,475
for not acting like a team!

255
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:47,539
Team! Team team team team team!

256
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,596
I even love saying the word "team".

257
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,795
You probably think that's a picture
of my family?

258
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:55,734
It's the A-Team.

259
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:00,500
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

260
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,059
All of them!

261
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,904
So what do you wanna tell me?

262
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,526
Well, it's just not working out.

263
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,376
- He's joking!
- But you said...

264
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,483
Not working out?

265
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,213
Oh no! No!

266
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,643
We are getting on like
a big house on fire!

267
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,497
- Yeah!
- My ear's getting hot!

268
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,320
No... You know what?
We should leave, now, because

269
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:23,773
you know, you're a busy man

270
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,803
and we've taken far too much
of your time.

271
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,623
Jen could you just get the door
for me there?

272
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,673
Absolutely Roy!

273
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,437
So why did you come here
in the first place?

274
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:36,934
We set up a voice activation system
on your computer.

275
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,523
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

276
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:41,269
It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice

277
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:43,423
but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!

278
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:44,518
- Bye bye!
- Thank you!

279
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:45,977
How exciting!

280
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:50,488
Hello...

281
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:55,060
Hello computer!

282
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,160
Hello!

283
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:04,763
Hello... Hello computer...

284
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,458
What good are you?

285
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,078
You obviously don't know anything
about computers.

286
00:17:12,106 --> 00:17:13,482
No but... OK.

287
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,866
But I can learn.

288
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:18,002
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

289
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:20,173
you could take me through
what you're doing right now.

290
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,401
I'd be delighted!

291
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,574
I'm just working on a very simple piece
of programming code.

292
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,166
I see...

293
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:38,118
Oh God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!

294
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,410
I don't know anything
about computers, I mean...

295
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:44,518
I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.

296
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:50,383
Hi! Is... Roy around?

297
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:52,555
Hello there little lady!

298
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,121
Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.

299
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,942
You wanted me to come down?!

300
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:02,104
Well here I am!!

301
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,511
Not the face!!

302
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,556
Not the face!!

303
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:08,083
Well maybe this will teach you

304
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:10,643
to treat people with
a little bit of respect!

305
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,827
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone
earlier?

306
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:18,518
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

307
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,180
Yes!

308
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,984
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

309
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,240
No, no no no! Got them in a sale.

310
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,550
Oh God! Clever you!

311
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:27,487
I'm never lucky enough
to get a bargain myself.

312
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,052
Well, I should take you shopping.

313
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,019
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

314
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,481
Oh I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you! Take care!

315
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:37,076
- Nice meeting you!
- Chairman! Wow!

316
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:39,613
You just diffuse that entire situation!

317
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,908
What situation?

318
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:45,221
Oh oh, that.. yeah!
Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

319
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,367
They're fairly regular,
the beatings, yes.

320
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,850
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

321
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,578
Ah it's not all that bad!

322
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:55,315
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

323
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:58,637
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean...

324
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:00,975
I'm a people person and...

325
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,660
people like you need a person
to deal with people...

326
00:19:03,693 --> 00:19:06,343
a people person like me. Oh my God!

327
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:09,231
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!

328
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,295
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

329
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,619
if I told you that I had a plan

330
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,671
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?

331
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,675
I can't be done! You're crazy!

332
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:23,442
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out! Ok!

333
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,924
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

334
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:53,277
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY

335
00:19:55,748 --> 00:20:02,333
No no! Oh no, really really really,
that was a true story!

336
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,770
Unbelievable!

337
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:06,857
I said why we don't go out
with the I.T. guys more often?

338
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:09,181
- You're hilarious!
- Yes we are!

339
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,636
You guys should come down here
more often you know,

340
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:16,340
you should see this as a new era
for Reynholm Industries.

341
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,227
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

342
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:22,710
Oh Do you know what! If you want
to hear something really funny,

343
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:23,867
a really funny story,

344
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:25,570
you should hear what happened
to Moss and I,

345
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:27,264
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

346
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,204
that Moss lost his glasses!

347
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,435
Moss! Moss!

348
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:33,028
Come here! Come here!

349
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,947
Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

350
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:36,623
Really?

351
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,220
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

352
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,062
Oh this a great story,
you're gonna love it!

353
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,911
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

354
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,281
Well go on, then.

355
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,187
All right.

356
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,332
- Well, one night, we were really drunk.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:58,744
And  huh, we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

358
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:03,527
And when they arrived to the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

359
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,311
so we brought them to the fair.

360
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,084
Oh really nice! In the end,
they only charged us half.

361
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,219
But we did have to pay
for all the rides.

362
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:20,512
Oh isn't that just the best story?

363
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,152
Oh, man!

364
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,616
You told me to never tell that story
to anyone.

365
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,889
Well, what're you talking about?
That's a brilliant story!

366
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,542
And then you nearly walked
into the canal!

367
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,403
Has it got to that part
with the boatman?

368
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:37,203
Do you mean the story
when I lost my glasses?

369
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,240
Yes!

370
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,956
What story did you think I mean?

371
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:50,956
Moss?

372
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:55,736
What did you say?! What did you say?!

373
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,499
It's all right for you two.

374
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,990
You're used to being social social piranhas...

375
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,333
I'm a very popular person usually.

376
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:14,275
That girl earlier, that tried
to beat me to death with her shoes,

377
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,336
did anybody get her number?

378
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:19,788
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

379
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,596
With Brandy and Crystal!

380
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,243
Hello I.T.?

381
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:33,622
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

382
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,877
Hello ! Hello !
